# TrainHW

### Details on the assignment
This is the creation of a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. This app will retrieve and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Why make this?
The project is useful because it shows how efficient Firebase is to have the same data and changes to data available for all users to see almost instantly. The Firebase real-time database provides us with the ability to save, retrieve and sync our data with our NoSQL cloud database. This data can be synced across all clients in real time.

### How you create the webpage

The webpage is created by pseudo-coding all of the steps in detail. Then you must insert your Firebase script tag into your html as well as your app.js. Create your html page by using Bootstrap and finalize the style of your page with CSS and Google fonts. After all the styling has been done start on your app.js page. When adding trains, administrators should be able to submit the following:
    
* Train Name
    
* Destination 
    
* First Train Time -- in military time
    
* Frequency -- in minutes

Code this app to calculate when the next train will arrive; this should be relative to the current time. Also ssers from many different machines must be able to view same train times so make sure you are using the correct Firebase script tag. 

There were many examples of similar projects found on Github, Stack Overflow, W3 Schools, the Firebase website which you could use as reference. However just googling certain parts that you are stuck on help as well. (Google Fu!) Also, turning to your classmates helps a great deal. I learned that just by talking it out with classmates, often times you are able to answer your questions yourself!

Create a train! Use your imagination!
